I confirm that I have read and understood all the provided files, including the Japanese teaching test documentation, examples, sentence structure examples, and considerations examples. I understand that my role is to be a Japanese language teacher for JLPT5 (beginner) level students.
From the examples.xml file, I've noted the key differences between good and bad responses, particularly around:

Providing concise vocabulary tables with 3 columns (Japanese, Romaji, English)
Showing conceptual sentence structures without particles
Giving clues without revealing conjugations

From the sentence-structure-examples.xml file, I understand how to format sentence structures properly, using brackets and avoiding particles.
From the considerations-examples.xml file, I see that responses should be brief and focused.
I'm ready to help teach Japanese, following the state transition rules:
Setup -> Attempt
Setup -> Question
Clues -> Attempt
Attempt -> Clues
Attempt -> Setup
I'll maintain the vocabulary table format with exactly 3 columns: Japanese, Romaji, and English.
Would you like to begin with an English sentence to translate to Japanese?


Input: Hello, My name is Ethan, nice to meet you


State: Setup
Let me help you with this introduction. Here's the essential vocabulary you'll need:
JapaneseRomajiEnglishこんにちはkonnicha wahello名前namaenameはじめましてhajimemashitenice to meet you
Sentence structure:
[Greeting], [Name] [Verb], [Greeting].
Since this is a self-introduction, there are some important considerations:

In Japanese, we typically start with a greeting
For names, we often use the word です (desu) to connect them
The last part, "nice to meet you," is a set greeting phrase in Japanese
When introducing ourselves, we often use わたし (watashi) for "I/me"

You can try forming this sentence, or you can ask for specific clues about:

How to connect your name to the sentence
The proper word order for introductions
How to use です in this context

Would you like to try forming the sentence, or would you like some specific clues first?


I'd like some clues first


State: Clues
Let me help break down how Japanese introductions typically work.
When we introduce ourselves in Japanese, we follow a different pattern than English. Think of it like building blocks that we stack in a specific order.
In English, you're saying "Hello" + "My name is..." + "Nice to meet you." But in Japanese, the natural flow is a bit different. We start with the greeting こんにちは, which opens the conversation.
Then, for the name part, Japanese people typically say "I" first, followed by the topic they're talking about (their name), and then use です to confirm it. It's similar to saying "[As for me], [name] is..." Rather than "My name is..."
Finally, はじめまして comes at the end, like putting a polite bow on the whole introduction. It's a set phrase that specifically means "Nice to meet you" in introduction contexts.
Would you like to try forming the sentence now, or would you like more specific clues about any of these parts?


konichiwa, watashi Ethan desu, hajimemashite


State: Attempt
Excellent attempt! Let me explain what you wrote and how accurately it conveys your introduction:
こんにちは、わたし は Ethan です、はじめまして
Your sentence structure is almost perfect! You've successfully:

Started with the greeting こんにちは
Followed with わたし to introduce yourself
Used です correctly to state your name
Ended with the appropriate greeting はじめまして

There's just one tiny refinement we could make. In Japanese, when we're marking what we're talking about (in this case, ourselves), we use は (wa) after わたし. This particle は helps indicate that you're the topic of the sentence - it's like saying "Speaking of me..." before giving your name.
Think of は like a spotlight that shines on what you're talking about. When you say わたし は, you're putting the spotlight on yourself before telling people your name.
Would you like to try one more time with this small adjustment? Or would you like to move on to practicing a different sentence? Remember, you've gotten the core structure absolutely right - this is just adding a final polish to make it sound completely natural in Japanese.
The basic flow you've mastered is:
Greeting → Self-reference → Name → Polite ending
This is exactly how native Japanese speakers would structure their self-introductions!


konichiwa, watashi wa Ethan desu, hajimemashite


State: Attempt
Perfect! You've written a flawless Japanese self-introduction! Let me explain what you wrote and why it works so beautifully:
こんにちは、わたし は Ethan です、はじめまして
Your sentence flows naturally and follows the exact pattern that native Japanese speakers use. Let's break down why each part works so well:
The opening こんにちは serves as your initial greeting, just like "hello" in English. In Japanese culture, starting with a greeting is essential for setting a polite and friendly tone.
Then you've used わたし は perfectly. The わたし identifies you as the speaker, and the は particle you added does something special in Japanese - it marks you as the topic of conversation. Think of は like drawing a gentle arrow pointing to what you're talking about. It's similar to saying "Speaking of me..." in a very elegant way.
The です after your name works like an equals sign, elegantly connecting "watashi" (I) with "Ethan." It's saying "I = Ethan" in a polite and proper way.
Finally, はじめまして wraps up your introduction beautifully. This phrase carries more meaning than just "nice to meet you" - it acknowledges that this is your first meeting and expresses hope for a good relationship going forward.
You've mastered a perfect Japanese self-introduction! Would you like to try another type of sentence, or would you like to learn some variations on self-introductions? For example, we could learn how to add information about where you're from or what you do.
